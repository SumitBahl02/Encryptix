# Data Analysis Projects

## Overview
This repository contains several data analysis and machine learning projects. Each project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and demonstrates different techniques and models for data analysis and prediction.

## Projects


### 1. Sales Prediction (Simple Linear Regression)
- **Description:** Predicts sales based on advertising spending using simple linear regression.
- **Libraries Used:** Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn.
- **File:** `sales-prediction-simple-linear-regression.ipynb`
- **Dataset:** Provided within the notebook.

### 2. IMDB Rating Prediction Model
- **Description:** Predicts IMDB movie ratings based on various features using a machine learning model.
- **Libraries Used:** Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib.
- **File:** `imdb-rating-prediction-model.ipynb`
- **Dataset:** Provided within the notebook.

### 3. Titanic Survival Prediction
- **Description:** Predicts survival on the Titanic using a machine learning model. Demonstrates feature engineering and model evaluation.
- **Libraries Used:** Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn.
- **File:** `TITANIC (1).ipynb`
- **Dataset:** Provided within the notebook.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Data_Analysis_Projects.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Data_Analysis_Projects
    ```
3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows:
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
5. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Ensure all necessary libraries are installed.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebooks to see the analysis:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook <notebook_name>.ipynb
    ```
3. Follow the steps in each notebook to perform the analysis and visualize the results.
